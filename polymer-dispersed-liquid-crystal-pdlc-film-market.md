<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>None-Adhesive PDLC Film</li><li>Self-Adhesive PDLC Film</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) Film is a type of film that contains liquid crystals dispersed in a polymer matrix. There are two main types of PDLC films: None-Adhesive PDLC Film and Self-Adhesive PDLC Film. None-Adhesive PDLC Film requires a separate adhesive layer to be applied to a surface, whereas Self-Adhesive PDLC Film has a built-in adhesive layer that allows it to be directly applied without the need for an additional adhesive. Both types offer the same functionality of controlling light transmission by applying an electric current, but the difference lies in the ease of installation and flexibility in use.</p></p>
