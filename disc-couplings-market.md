<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disc Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Disc Couplings</li><li>Double Disc Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Disc couplings are mechanical devices used to connect rotating shafts for transmitting torque while allowing for misalignment. Single disc couplings consist of a single disc with two hubs that can accommodate angular, axial, and parallel misalignments. They are suitable for applications requiring low torque transmission. Double disc couplings have two discs and three hubs, providing higher torque transmission capacity and excellent torsional stiffness. They are used in high-speed applications requiring precise alignment. Both types of disc couplings minimize vibration and reduce the risk of equipment failure.</p></p>
