<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Protection Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementitious Coatings</li><li>Intumescent Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire protection coatings are used to provide passive fire protection to surfaces, preventing or delaying the spread of fire and protecting structures. One type of fire protection coating is cementitious coatings, which are made of cement, fillers, and additives. They form an insulating layer when applied and provide protection by releasing water vapor when exposed to high temperatures. Intumescent coatings, on the other hand, contain reactive materials that expand when exposed to fire, forming a char layer that insulates the substrate and delays the spread of fire.</p></p>
