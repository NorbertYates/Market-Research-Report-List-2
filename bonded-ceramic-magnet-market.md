<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bonded Ceramic Magnet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extruding</li><li>Injection Molding</li><li>Calendering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bonded ceramic magnet market includes three main types of manufacturing processes: extruding, injection molding, and calendering. In the extruding process, the ceramic magnetic material is forced through a die to form the desired shape. Injection molding involves injecting a molten ceramic magnetic material into a mold where it solidifies and takes the desired shape. Calendering uses a rolling process to spread layers of ceramic magnetic material and then compress them into the desired shape. These processes are used to manufacture different types of bonded ceramic magnets with specific shapes and properties.</p></p>
