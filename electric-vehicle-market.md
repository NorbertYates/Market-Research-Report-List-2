<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PHEV</li><li>BEV</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electric vehicle market is primarily divided into two types: PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle) and BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle). PHEVs have both an internal combustion engine and a battery pack, allowing them to switch between gasoline and electric power. They typically have limited electric range and are mainly used for short commutes. On the other hand, BEVs solely rely on electric power obtained from a battery pack and have no internal combustion engine. They offer longer electric range and are suitable for all-electric driving without any emissions.</p></p>
