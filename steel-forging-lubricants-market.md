<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steel Forging Lubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Graphite-based Forging Lubricants</li><li>Non-Graphite-based Forging Lubricants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steel forging lubricants are used to reduce friction and wear during the forging process. There are two main types of steel forging lubricants: graphite-based and non-graphite-based. Graphite-based lubricants contain graphite particles which provide excellent lubrication and release properties. They are commonly used for hot forging applications. Non-graphite-based lubricants, on the other hand, do not contain graphite and are suitable for both hot and cold forging processes. They offer improved cleanability and reduced environmental impact compared to graphite-based lubricants.</p></p>
