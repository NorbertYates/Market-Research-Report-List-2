<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Honeycomb Ceramic Carrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight-through Carriers</li><li>Wall Flow Carriers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive honeycomb ceramic carrier market consists of two major types: straight-through carriers and wall flow carriers. Straight-through carriers have a honeycomb structure with open channels, allowing exhaust gas to pass directly through them. On the other hand, wall flow carriers have alternate channels blocked at the inlet and outlet ends, forcing gas to pass through the porous walls of the channels. Both types are used in automotive exhaust systems to trap and filter harmful pollutants, but they differ in terms of flow patterns and filtration efficiency.</p></p>
