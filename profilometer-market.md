<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Profilometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Profilometer</li><li>Non-contact Profilometer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>A profilometer is a device used for measuring the surface profile of an object. There are two types of profilometers in the market: Contact and Non-contact profilometers. Contact profilometers use a probe or stylus that physically touches the surface being measured, providing accurate results but may risk damaging delicate surfaces. On the other hand, non-contact profilometers use optical, laser, or confocal technologies to measure the surface without physical contact, ensuring the safety of delicate surfaces but may sacrifice some accuracy compared to contact profilometers. Both types cater to different needs and applications in industries such as manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and research.</p></p>
