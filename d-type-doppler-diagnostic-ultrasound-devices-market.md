<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The D type Doppler Diagnostic Ultrasound Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CW</li><li>PW</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>D type Doppler diagnostic ultrasound devices are medical imaging devices that use sound waves to create images of blood flow in the body. There are two main types of Doppler devices: Continuous Wave (CW) and Pulsed Wave (PW) devices. CW Doppler devices emit a continuous sound wave and measure the frequency shift of the reflected wave to determine blood flow velocity, allowing for accurate velocity measurements but limited depth resolution. PW Doppler devices emit short bursts of sound waves and measure the frequency shift of the reflected waves at specific depths, providing detailed information about blood flow velocity at different depths.</p></p>
