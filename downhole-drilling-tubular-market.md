<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Downhole Drilling Tubular Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drill Pipe</li><li>Heavy Drill Pipe</li><li>Drill Collar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The downhole drilling tubular market consists of three main types: drill pipe, heavy drill pipe, and drill collar. Drill pipe is a hollow steel pipe used to transmit drilling fluid and torque to the drill bit during the drilling process. Heavy drill pipe is similar to drill pipe but has thicker walls, providing extra weight for better control of the drill bit. Drill collars are heavy, thick-walled steel tubes placed above the drill bit to apply weight and stiffness for directional drilling and preventing buckling.</p></p>
