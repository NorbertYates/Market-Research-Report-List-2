<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE Plastic Bottle Recycling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Recycling</li><li>Mechanical Recycling</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>HDPE plastic bottle recycling is carried out through two main market types: chemical recycling and mechanical recycling. Chemical recycling involves converting the HDPE plastic bottles into their original monomer form through various chemical processes. This allows for the creation of new plastic products with the same properties as the original bottles. On the other hand, mechanical recycling involves melting down the HDPE plastic bottles and reforming them into new products, such as packaging materials or fibers. Both market types contribute to reducing plastic waste and promoting a more sustainable approach to plastic bottle disposal.</p></p>
