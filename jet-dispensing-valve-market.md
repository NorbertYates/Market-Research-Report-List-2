<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jet Dispensing Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Jet Valves</li><li>Non-contact Jet Valves</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Jet Dispensing Valve market is divided into two types: Contact Jet Valves and Non-contact Jet Valves. Contact Jet Valves are designed to physically contact the substrate or surface during dispensing, ensuring precise control and accuracy. On the other hand, Non-contact Jet Valves do not make direct physical contact, instead using air pressure to dispense materials without touching the surface. Both types have their advantages and are suitable for different applications, depending on factors such as material viscosity, substrate type, and desired dispensing volume.</p></p>
