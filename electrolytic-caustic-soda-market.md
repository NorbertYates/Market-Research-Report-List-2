<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrolytic Caustic Soda Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mercury Process</li><li>Diaphragm Process</li><li>Ion-Exchange Membrane Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrolytic caustic soda market can be categorized into three main types: Mercury process, Diaphragm process, and Ion-Exchange Membrane process. In the Mercury process, electrolysis of sodium chloride occurs in a mercury cell, resulting in the production of caustic soda, chlorine, and hydrogen. The Diaphragm process utilizes a diaphragm to separate the electrolyte compartments, preventing the mixing of chlorine and caustic soda during the electrolysis process. The Ion-Exchange Membrane process involves the use of an ion-exchange membrane, which selectively transfers ions between the anode and cathode compartments, resulting in the production of caustic soda and chlorine gas.</p></p>
