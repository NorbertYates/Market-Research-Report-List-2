<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum-Nickel-Cobalt Magnets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast Type</li><li>Sintered Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aluminum-Nickel-Cobalt (AlNiCo) magnets are categorized into two main market types: Cast Type and Sintered Type. Cast Type magnets are made by pouring molten metal into a mold, resulting in a flexible manufacturing process and the ability to achieve complex shapes. Sintered Type magnets, on the other hand, are formed by pressing powdered metal into the desired shape and then sintering it at a high temperature to bond the particles. Sintered magnets offer higher magnetic properties and dimensional precision but come at a higher cost compared to Cast Type magnets.</p></p>
