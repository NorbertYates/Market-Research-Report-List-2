<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Resin Bonding Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-etching</li><li>Selective-etching</li><li>Total-etching</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite resin bonding agents are used in dentistry to bond tooth-colored restorations to natural teeth. These bonding agents come in three different types: self-etching, selective-etching, and total-etching. </p><p>Self-etching bonding agents are a one-step process where the agent simultaneously etches the tooth surface and bonds the restoration. Selective-etching bonding agents involve selectively etching the enamel or dentin before applying the bonding agent. Total-etching bonding agents involve etching both enamel and dentin separately before applying the bonding agent. Each type has its own advantages and is chosen based on the clinical conditions and the preferences of the dentist.</p></p>
