<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wood Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic Type</li><li>Organic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wood Flame Retardant Market Types include Inorganic Type and Organic Type. Inorganic Type refers to flame retardant chemicals that are derived from non-living matter, such as minerals and salts. They work by releasing water molecules and forming a protective layer on the wood surface, hindering combustion. Organic Type, on the other hand, consists of flame retardant chemicals derived from living matter, such as plants or animals. These chemicals inhibit the ignition and spread of flames by releasing gases that dilute the oxygen in the surrounding environment and cool down the wood.</p></p>
