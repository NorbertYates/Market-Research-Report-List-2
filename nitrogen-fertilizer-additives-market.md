<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Urease Inhibitors Based Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives</li><li>Nitrification Inhibitor Based Nitrogen Fertilizer Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urease inhibitors based nitrogen fertilizer additives are compounds added to fertilizers to slow down the process of urea hydrolysis, which prevents the loss of nitrogen through ammonia volatilization. These additives increase the efficiency of nitrogen uptake by plants and reduce the environmental impact. On the other hand, nitrification inhibitors based nitrogen fertilizer additives inhibit the process of nitrification, which is the conversion of ammonium to nitrate by soil microorganisms. These additives help to retain nitrogen in the ammonium form, reducing the leaching and denitrification losses.</p></p>
