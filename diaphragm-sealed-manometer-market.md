<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Sealed Manometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>U Tube Manometers</li><li>Inclined Tube Manometers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The diaphragm sealed manometer market consists of two main types: U tube manometers and inclined tube manometers. U tube manometers feature a U-shaped tube partially filled with a liquid, with the pressure being measured causing a difference in the liquid levels in each leg of the tube. Inclined tube manometers function similarly but have a tilted tube instead, making them more suitable for measuring low pressures. Both types are widely used in various industries to measure and monitor pressure differences accurately and efficiently.</p></p>
