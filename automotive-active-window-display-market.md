<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Active Window Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combiner Technology</li><li>Windshield Technology</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Automotive Active Window Display market is categorized into two types: Combiner Technology and Windshield Technology. Combiner Technology involves the use of a small transparent screen placed in front of the driver's line of sight, reflecting relevant information onto it. This type of display is less expensive but limited in terms of display size and brightness. On the other hand, Windshield Technology integrates the display directly into the windshield, offering larger, clearer, and more vibrant images. However, this technology is more expensive and complex to implement.</p></p>
