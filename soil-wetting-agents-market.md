<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Wetting Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyacrylic Acid Salt</li><li>Polyacrylamide</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soil wetting agents are substances used to improve water penetration and distribution in soil, promoting healthy plant growth. There are two main types of soil wetting agents: Polyacrylic Acid Salt and Polyacrylamide. Polyacrylic Acid Salt acts as a dispersing agent by reducing surface tension and allowing water to spread evenly throughout the soil. Polyacrylamide, on the other hand, absorbs water and retains it in the soil, making it available to plants for a longer period of time. These wetting agents are commonly used in agriculture and gardening applications to optimize water usage and promote better plant health.</p></p>
