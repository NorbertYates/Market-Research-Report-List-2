<p><strong>The Spine Implants Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Spine Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spine implants market finds application in two main segments - open spine surgery and minimally invasive spine surgery. Open spine surgery refers to the traditional approach that involves large incisions and direct access to the spine. On the other hand, minimally invasive spine surgery uses smaller incisions and specialized tools to access the spine, resulting in reduced tissue damage and faster recovery. Both these approaches require spine implants, such as plates, screws, rods, and interbody cages, to stabilize the spine and promote fusion.</p></p>
