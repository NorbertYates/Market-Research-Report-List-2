<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Actuator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return HVAC Actuator</li><li>Non-Spring Return HVAC Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The HVAC actuator market consists of two main types: spring return HVAC actuators and non-spring return HVAC actuators. Spring return actuators use a spring mechanism to operate, allowing them to return to their default position when power is cut off. They are commonly used for applications where fail-safe operation is required. On the other hand, non-spring return actuators do not rely on a spring mechanism and maintain their position even without power. They are usually used for modulating control applications where precise positioning is essential.</p></p>
