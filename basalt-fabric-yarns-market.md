<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Basalt Fabric Yarns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Basalt Chopped Fiber</li><li>Basalt Continuous Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Basalt fabric yarns refer to a type of yarn made from basalt fibers, which are derived from volcanic rock. There are two main types of basalt fabric yarns in the market: basalt chopped fiber and basalt continuous fiber. Basalt chopped fiber is made by cutting the basalt fibers into shorter lengths, which are then spun into yarns. Basalt continuous fiber, on the other hand, is produced by pulling the fibers continuously from the molten basalt and spinning them into yarns without cutting them. Both types of yarns have diverse applications across various industries due to their excellent mechanical properties and resistance to heat and chemicals.</p></p>
