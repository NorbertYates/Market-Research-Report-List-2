<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Presbyopia Correction Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corneal Inlays</li><li>Scleral Implants</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Implantable presbyopia correction devices refer to medical devices used to address age-related vision decline, known as presbyopia. Two common types of devices in this market are corneal inlays and scleral implants. Corneal inlays are tiny lenses inserted into the cornea to improve near vision, while scleral implants involve placing a small device in the sclera (white of the eye) for vision enhancement. Both devices aim to adjust the eye's focusing power, allowing individuals with presbyopia to see objects at different distances more clearly.</p></p>

<p><strong>Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>The implantable presbyopia correction devices market has been witnessing significant growth in recent years, with several key players competing in the industry. Three major companies in this market segment are AcuFocus, Refocus, and Presbia. </p><p>AcuFocus is a California-based medical device company that focuses on developing solutions for presbyopia, a common age-related vision disorder. The company's flagship product is the Kamra inlay, an implantable device that improves near vision in individuals with presbyopia. AcuFocus received FDA approval for the Kamra inlay in 2015 and has experienced substantial market success since then. The company has been steadily expanding its global reach through partnerships and collaborations with leading ophthalmic distributors. As of 2020, AcuFocus reported annual sales revenue of around $20 million.</p><p>Refocus is another prominent player in the implantable presbyopia correction devices market. The company was acquired by the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis in February 2018, as a part of their strategic move into the ophthalmology sector. Refocus developed the Raindrop Near Vision Inlay, an implantable device that serves as a treatment option for presbyopia. The acquisition by Novartis demonstrates the growing interest and potential of the implantable presbyopia correction market. However, specific sales revenue figures for Refocus are not publicly available due to the company's acquisition and subsequent integration into Novartis.</p><p>Presbia, a Dublin-based medical device company, is dedicated to developing innovative solutions for presbyopia. Their flagship product, the Flexivue Microlens, is an implantable device that improves near vision in people with presbyopia. Presbia received CE Mark approval for their Flexivue Microlens in 2010 and has since expanded its commercial presence in Europe and other international markets. Like Refocus, specific sales revenue figures for Presbia are not publicly available.</p><p>The implantable presbyopia correction devices market is expected to witness significant growth in the coming years, driven by an increasing aging population and a growing demand for minimally invasive vision correction procedures. The market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, with a strong focus on research and development and technological advances in the field of ophthalmology.</p></p>
