<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Propulsion Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Breathing</li><li>Non-Air Breathing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aviation propulsion systems market can be categorized into two types: air-breathing and non-air breathing systems. Air-breathing systems, such as turbofan engines, draw in air from the atmosphere to generate thrust. These systems are commonly used in commercial aircraft. On the other hand, non-air breathing systems, like rocket engines, do not rely on atmospheric air. They carry their own oxidizer, enabling them to operate in environments with no air, such as space. Non-air breathing systems are predominantly used in aerospace applications, including space shuttles and satellites.</p></p>
