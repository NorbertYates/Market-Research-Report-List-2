<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shark Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Barrier</li><li>Electronic Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The market for shark barriers consists of two main types: physical barriers and electronic barriers. Physical barriers are physical structures, such as nets or fences, that are installed in the water to physically separate sharks from humans. Electronic barriers, on the other hand, rely on technology to create an invisible barrier using sound waves or electric pulses to deter sharks. Both types aim to provide a safe swimming environment by reducing the risk of shark attacks and are sought after by beachgoers and coastal communities.</p></p>
