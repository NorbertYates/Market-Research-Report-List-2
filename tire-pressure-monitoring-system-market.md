<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct TPMS</li><li>Indirect TPMS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) market consists of two types: Direct TPMS and Indirect TPMS. Direct TPMS relies on sensors located in each tire to measure the tire pressure and send real-time data to the driver. This system offers accurate and reliable readings, ensuring optimal tire performance and safety. On the other hand, Indirect TPMS uses the wheel speed sensors of the anti-lock braking system to estimate tire pressure based on rotational speed differences. Although less expensive, it may exhibit lower accuracy and slower response time compared to the direct approach.</p></p>
