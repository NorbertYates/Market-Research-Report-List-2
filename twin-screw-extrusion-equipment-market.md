<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Twin Screw Extrusion Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Meshing Type Extrusion Equipment</li><li>Non Meshing Type Extrusion Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Meshing Type Extrusion Equipment refers to twin screw extruders that have intermeshing screws, which means the screws have teeth that mesh together during the extrusion process. This design allows for better mixing, dispersion, and compounding of materials. Non-Meshing Type Extrusion Equipment, on the other hand, refers to twin screw extruders with non-intermeshing screws. These screws do not make contact with each other, which can be advantageous for processing shear-sensitive materials or when precise control of the screw configuration is required.</p></p>
